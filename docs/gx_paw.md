# General

From our original PAW implementation, we have devel-
oped a portable PAW library, called LIBPAW in order to
facilitate the porting of PAW in other codes. This library provides
a formalism for computational physics — the pseudopo-
tential/PAW approach — at a relatively high implementation
level (not only low-level methods, such as I/O, error-handling
or systems resolution). It is packaged in such a way that it
gives access to implementations of core PAW procedures with
basis-independent data interfaces and thus can potentially be
combined with any other basis used in different programs.
