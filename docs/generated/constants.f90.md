# `constants.f90`

## Overview

The `constants` Fortran module in the `GX-common` component is intended to provide a centralized definition for fundamental physical and mathematical constants, as well as utility constants used throughout the GreenX library. The module emphasizes the use of CODATA 2018 recommendations for physical constants to ensure accuracy and standardization.

Although the provided snippet primarily defines Pi and some utility constants, it establishes a guideline for adding other physical constants:
- They should be based on CODATA 2018.
- They must be defined using double precision (`dp`).
- They should have descriptive names.

## Key Components

This module directly defines parameters.

## Important Variables/Constants

- **`pi`**:
    - Type: `real(kind=dp), parameter`
    - Value: `3.14159265358979323846264338_dp`
    - Description: The mathematical constant Pi.

- **`ch10`**:
    - Type: `character(len=1), parameter`
    - Value: `char(10)`
    - Description: A character constant representing the newline character (ASCII line feed). Useful for formatting output strings.

- **`err_len`**:
    - Type: `integer, parameter`
    - Value: `1024`
    - Description: An integer constant defining an arbitrary standard length for error message character strings used elsewhere in the library.

## Usage Examples

```fortran
module example_using_constants
  use constants
  use kinds, only: dp ! Assuming dp is from a module like 'kinds'
  implicit none

  real(kind=dp) :: circumference, radius
  character(len=err_len) :: error_message_buffer

  radius = 10.0_dp
  circumference = 2.0_dp * pi * radius

  print *, "Circumference of a circle with radius ", radius, " is ", circumference
  print *, "A new line character:" // ch10 // "This is on a new line."

  ! error_message_buffer can be used to store error messages of standard length
  error_message_buffer = "An example error message."

end module example_using_constants
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **`kinds`**: The `constants` module uses the `kinds` module to access the `dp` parameter, which defines the kind for double-precision real numbers. This ensures that constants like `pi` are stored with sufficient precision.
- Other modules in the GreenX library can `use constants` to access these fundamental values. The introductory comment suggests that physical constants, if added, should adhere to CODATA 2018, implying an interaction with or adherence to external standards for scientific data.

This module promotes consistency by providing a single source for important constant values.
