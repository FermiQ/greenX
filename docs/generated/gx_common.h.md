# `gx_common.h`

## Overview

This header file provides a common macro for error registration within the GX-TimeFrequency module. Its primary purpose is to offer a consistent way to report errors, potentially with source file and line number information if supported by the Fortran compiler.

## Key Components

- **`_REGISTER_EXC(msg)`**: A preprocessor macro that calls the `register_exc` function.
    - If `HAVE_FC_LONG_LINES` is defined, the macro passes the message (`msg`), the current filename (`__FILE__`), and line number (`__LINE__`) to `register_exc`. This allows for more precise error reporting.
    - Otherwise, it only passes the message (`msg`) to `register_exc`.

## Important Variables/Constants

There are no explicit variables or constants defined in this file. The key element is the preprocessor macro `_REGISTER_EXC`.

## Usage Examples

This file itself does not contain executable examples, but the macro would be used elsewhere in the codebase like this:

```c
// In a Fortran (.F90) file that includes gx_common.h
#include "gx_common.h"

subroutine my_subroutine(arg)
  implicit none
  integer, intent(in) :: arg
  if (arg < 0) then
    _REGISTER_EXC("Argument cannot be negative")
    return
  end if
  ! ... rest of the subroutine
end subroutine my_subroutine
```

(Note: The example above is illustrative. The actual `register_exc` function and its usage would be defined elsewhere.)

## Dependencies and Interactions

- **`register_exc` function**: This macro depends on an external function `register_exc` which is expected to be available at link time. This function is responsible for the actual error handling mechanism (e.g., printing the message, logging, or terminating the program).
- **`HAVE_FC_LONG_LINES`**: The behavior of the macro is conditional on this preprocessor flag. This flag indicates whether the Fortran compiler supports long lines, which in turn affects whether `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` macros are available or handled correctly.
- This file is intended to be included in other source files (likely Fortran files given the context) within the GX-TimeFrequency module.
