# Overview

A new open-source library that supports exascale implementations of Green-function-based methodologies. Its layered design will separate higher-level functionalities (distinguishing between code-independent and code-family-specific parts) from architecture-dependent numerical routines, common to all code families.

# Components
- [Structure of the library](structure.md)
- [Minimax Time-Frequency](gx_time_frequency.md)
- [Analytic Continuation](gx_ac.md)
