## GreenX library - LAPW (Linearized Augmented Plane Wave)

The cubic scaling GW method is implemented in exciting following 
the approach described by Kutepov et al[@kutepov2017linearized].
A key distinction between Kutepov's methodology and ours lies in 
their utilization of Matsubara frequencies, whereas we employ 
the zero-temperature approach relying on imaginary time.
