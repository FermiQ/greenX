Unit Testing TODOs

* Add Zofu to CMake
 - Have it pull and build if not detected
* Look at how to write explicit interfaces for base class method, when one
  intends to overload in the child class
* Have a unit test initialisation module that selects the correct class
  - currently only one available
* Set up a unit test to check the wrapper (which will be scrapped as soon
  as this gets used for an actual test)
* Add unit test builds for each library to CMake
  - May need to introduce the driver generator I wrote for Zofu, OR have people
    manually write them
* Add unit testing to the CI
